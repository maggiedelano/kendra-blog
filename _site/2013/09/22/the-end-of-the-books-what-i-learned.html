    <p>So I’m done with the <a href="http://www.kendraalbert.com/2020/07/11/2013-01-06-new-years-resolution-5-books-a-week.html">great book reading project of 2013</a>. (As I joked on Twitter, that means I’m done reading books forever, right?) I’ve compiled a list of recommendations, which are available <a href="http://www.kendraalbert.com/books">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some basic facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I started January 1st, 2013.</li>
  <li>I finished September 7th, 2013.</li>
  <li>I read 176 books. (That’s about 22 per month or a book every 1.4 days.)</li>
  <li>29% of the authors were people of color.</li>
  <li>49% of the authors were women, 51% were men.</li>
  <li>The furthest behind I got was 16 books. (<a href="http://www.kendraalbert.com/2020/07/11/2013-06-23-falling-off-the-wagon.html">More about that</a>.)</li>
  <li>I never really got that far ahead; maybe by one book, once or twice.<!-- more --></li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s what I learned:</p>

<p>1) I can actually read 5 books a week (or one a day, if I don’t have a job).</p>

<p>When I started this project, I theorized that I could read 5 books a week without any real evidence that that was true, other than a rough idea of how long it took me to read a book. It turns out this is in fact a reachable goal, although it put a significant strain on my free time. When I was playing catch up over the summer, I could read a book a day, but it was not actually a ton of fun (despite having nothing but time on my hands.)</p>

<p>2) My hypotheses about my information diet without self-tracking were bullshit.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about this a little, but before I started keeping track of the diversity goals, I would have estimated I was reading 50/50 male/female authors. This was very much not true. Before I started to make dramatic changes to my reading calculus, it was very easy to reach for popular male authors instead of thinking critically about what I was reading. This goes ever more so for authors who are people of color - it’s really easy to read as a scifi/fantasy/pop science fan and not critically examine the types of work you’re encountering.</p>

<p>The self-tracking made me more conscious of how I made book choices - much less picking stuff off the shelf randomly, much more deliberative. I still took recommendations from friends, but it was tempered by knowing that I had to meet some more general goals.</p>

<p>I definitely got more and more committed to choosing books based on the diversity goals as I got closer to the end - and this actually meant that some of the books I read in the last month were my favorites. I was actually shocked by how hard it was for me to initially find books that peaked my interest by people of color. I suspect that was mostly because I hadn’t thought about my reading habits in those terms, and thus didn’t even know where to start. By the end, it was super easy to find more, which I consider possibly the biggest win of the entire thing.</p>

<p>3) It’s easy to get into ruts based on what you and your friends read.</p>

<p>See above, to some extent - but I definitely found that most of the recommendations I got from people I trust were for white dudes. It’s been really interesting to see how many of my favorite books, and the one’s I’ve been recommending were from authors I had never heard of or read before this year; Octavia Butler and N. K. Jemesin pop to mind as examples.</p>

<p>4) Reading leads to more reading.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the project, I definitely had days where I had no idea what to read next; both from the perspective of not having another book lined up, but also not knowing where to go to look for recommendations. Now I have a huge pile of books I’m super excited about (see below).</p>

<p>5) The book requirement led to some interesting incentives.</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought much at the beginning about how the requirements that the works be books would affect what I read. It changed a lot of my habits - it got to the point where I was just avoiding reading papers, because I knew they wouldn’t count towards what I was tracking.</p>

<p>Folks have suggested a word count goal, which would have been a good way to eliminate the weird incentives (books = good, everything else = bad). However, I have no idea how I would have kept track of that. I was fortunate to have Goodreads as a way to keep track of book numbers and my progress - although I’m struggling with how to export data from it for analysis.</p>

<p>Finally, what’s next? Well, this:</p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="667" data-orig-width="500"><img alt="image" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e66ccc0d4a483a63716d614a430a831/2ae3a2320b917c45-2d/s540x810/93f6fa38b08895254d5afbb0d250c48c014aab26.jpg" data-orig-height="667" data-orig-width="500" /></figure>

<p>That’s some textbooks, but also the pile of books that’s next on my list.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the final lesson:</p>

<p>6) After this summer, the law school reading load is actually pretty light.</p>

<p>That’s an upside I didn’t foresee.</p>
