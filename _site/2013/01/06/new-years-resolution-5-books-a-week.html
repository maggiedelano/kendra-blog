    <p>I’m not normally a New Year’s Resolution kind of person - in fact, I told my roommate that this year I would resolve to wash the dishes on Jan. 1st and call it a day. I did that, but then I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/12/new_year_s_resolutions_reading_a_book_every_day.html">Slate article</a> where the author undertook to read a book a day for a year. </p>

<p>Like most avid readers, I have what someone on Twitter called “the pile of shame” - books that I’ve promised that I’m going to read someday. (For me, it’s two piles on my desk and a corresponding larger set that lurks in my bookshelf.) Often, my reading eyes are bigger than my stomach (or my propensity to buy books on Amazon) and frankly, I haven’t made much progress on any of these in months.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Below, the current iteration of the pile of shame.<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500"><img alt="The current iteration of the book pile." src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/651b960af5135b0ad872ac0439aa5d5d/a15477a9f9ea1c6f-a8/s540x810/b94065193b7e6f8b23b516c0b63eb9eb04f2aa00.jpg" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500" /></figure></p>

<p>So, reading a book a day would be pretty cool. However, that pace would probably require giving up a number of activities I also enjoy  - video games, watching bad TV, cooking - and would become completely ridiculous when I enter school in the fall. Looking into the new year, I see setting some book goals as a way to get over my always-full pile of “books to read” and to have a way of incentivizing reading over screen-staring time. </p>

<p>I also have become inspired by my friend <a href="http://blog.dianakimball.com/">Diana Kimball</a>‘s experiments with public reading, and want a way to engage in more of a dialogue/reflective process around what I’m reading. So I’m embarking on a customized version of the challenge. Here are the rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I will read 260 books by January 1st, 2014. </li>
  <li>I will write a blog post for every 5 books I read - as a way of checking in. This may be every week (or less, or more, depending on a number of factors.)</li>
  <li>Audiobooks don’t count.</li>
  <li>Graphic novels do. </li>
  <li>Since the goal is to lower the number of books that I’ve gotten 10 pages into and never finished, finishing books I’ve started is allowed.</li>
  <li>I will try NOT to just read the shortest or most convenient books -the blog posts are a way of ensuring that I stay honest about this. </li>
  <li>I’m going to try for a mix of fiction and non-fiction. A lot of what I have lying around is non-fiction, but there’s always the <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/article/announcing-the-2013-tournament-of-books">Tournament of Books</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, without further ado, the first five:</p>

<p>In the service of having some sort of record abou this project, I’m going to write a few words, and put each book in a category at the end of the 5-book period.</p>

<p><strong>Best Written:</strong> Both Flesh and Not (not shockingly). This was my first DFW book, and there were many parts of it that I loved.</p>

<p><strong>Worst:</strong> One Good Turn, by a huge margin. It was terrible - badly written, self-indulgent, low on content and ultimately unsatisfying.</p>

<p><strong>Most Useful:</strong> Women Don’t Ask, which came highly recommended by many other women geeks.</p>

<p><strong>Book I was most excited to read:</strong>  The Law of Superheroes, which turned out to be okay. I was unhappy about the level of certainty that the authors seemed to come to on each question (things like: “Would Wolverine’s claws count as arms under the 2nd amendment?”). To me, the back and forth about the uncertainty is more interesting, so I came away a little disappointed.</p>

<p><strong>Book I’ve had for the longest:</strong>  In Other Worlds, which was good but repetitive. </p>
