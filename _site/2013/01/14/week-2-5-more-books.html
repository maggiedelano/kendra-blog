    <p>Despite a hellish travel schedule this weekend, I managed to actually meet my book quota: mostly through reading 2.5 books on a very long plane flight to San Francisco. Most of this week’s reading was actually pretty depressing, and with the death of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html?_r=0">Aaron Swartz</a>, who undertook <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2011">similar projects</a>, everything seemed to hit home a little harder than it would have otherwise. <!-- more --></p>

<p>What I read (sorry, no fancy picture):</p>

<p><strong>Captive Audience by Susan Crawford</strong></p>

<p>I had been waiting to read this for a while, and it didn’t disappoint. It feels a little disjoined, as the main part of the book is about the NBCUniversal/Comcast merger, but the intro and conclusion are far more broad. Still, Susan’s a great writer and can explain complicated topics like hot potato routing with ease.</p>

<p><strong>The Year of the Flood by Margaret Atwood</strong></p>

<p>Also a book that had been on my list for a while. It is set in the same world as Oryx and Crake, which I read years ago. I enjoyed it - there’s a good religious element and some strong storytelling, but I wish I had read it closer to Oryx and Crake. I think a lot of the cross-book characters and messages were lost on me.</p>

<p><strong>Pump Six and Other Stories by Paolo Bacigalupi</strong></p>

<p>This was the most depressing (and also the best fiction) of the books this week - it’s a collection of near to mid-future scifi, with some broad anti-corporate, anti-genetic modification themes. Lots of stories centered on characters of color or with lead characters who were non-Western, which puts it in sharp contrast with much of the genre. Only two of the stories were set in the same world, which I didn’t actually mind - it felt very cohesive as a collection. It was occasionally very hard to read, with lots of graphic violence and very difficult topics. Came recommended from a good source and was a great book.</p>

<p><strong>Magic for Beginners by Kelly Link</strong></p>

<p>Also a short story collection, also from an author I hadn’t read before, but very different than Pump Six. A lot of Kelly Link’s stories were fantastical, but also profoundly odd and strange. I often finished a story feeling like I had no idea what had happened, or what the story had meant. But the writing was fun, and I’m glad I took the time read the book all the way through.</p>

<p><strong>The Forms and Functions of Tort Law by Kenneth S. Abraham</strong></p>

<p>Shockingly, this book was for work. Not that I didn’t enjoy it, but it is, of course, a treatise on Torts, which focuses on the goals of tort law and some of the history of how it came to be. I found it a useful counterpart to the case reading I’d done - it gave a real sense of perspective. </p>
