            Dear Copyright Office, Let Game Fans Keep Abandoned Games Alive
          </a>
        </h3><p>When you buy a video game, you expect to be able to play it for as long as you want. You expect be able to play it with your kids many years from now if you want (well, maybe not Grand Theft Auto).  And you would hope that museums and media historians could preserve the games that were so important to your childhood. But unfortunately, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca-rulemaking" title="DMCA Rulemaking">anti-circumvention provisions</a> (17 U.S.C. § 1201, or Section 1201) creates legal risks for players who want to keep playing after game servers shut down, and curators who want to preserve games for posterity. That’s why I’m spearheading an effort to win legal protection for game enthusiasts and preservationists who want to keep abandoned games alive by running multiplayer servers or eliminating authentication mechanisms. On Friday, EFF and I filed <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/eff-comments-dmca-exemption-abandoned-games" title="EFF Comments on a DMCA Exemption for Abandoned Games">comments</a> with the Copyright Office asking for a new exemption to Section 1201.</p>

            Perma: Solving Link Rot and Reference Rot
          </a>
        </h3><p>Jonathan Zittrain, Larry Lessig and I have been working on a paper laying out some empirical evidence of linkrot and reference rot in law review and Supreme Court citations, and proposing a solution, which is called <a href="http://www.perma.cc">Perma.cc</a>. Our research found that 49% of links in SCOTUS opinions and between 60-70% of journal links are broken - a huge number that only increases as time passes. The full results are available at the draft on <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2329161">SSRN</a>. </p>

Basically, it’s like World of Warcraft. However, Guild Wars 2 has done a bunch of things that I think will fundamentally change the genre from the funk that it has been in since WoW became the game to compete with. Those changes have made me reflect on how a couple of code tweaks can totally change the way people play a game and relate to other players. <!-- more --></p>

            Some Quick Book Reviews
          </a>
        </h3><p>So I was on vacation recently - and I used that time to catch up on some books I’d been meaning to read. Hence, some opinions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reamde-A-Novel-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0061977969">Reamde</a> <br />
<strong>What is it:</strong> I know it came out a year ago, but I finally got around to reading Neal Stephenson’s Reamde. It’s more than 900 pages long, and the title (and central theme) involves some gold farming exploits in a MMORPG (massive multiplayer online roleplaying game, like World of Warcraft) called T’Rain. The main characters get caught up in some ridiculous intrigue and antics as a result of the goldfarming, including getting captured by terrorists and (almost) stuck in China.</p>

<p><strong>Should you read it:</strong> If you like Cryptonomicon, yes. If you like Snowcrash, maybe. If you were a bigger fan of Diamond Age or Anathem, you might skip it. If you have some categorical desire to read everything Stephenson ever wrote (like me), you were going to read it anyway.</p>

<p>The key part is that it’s barely science fiction. Most of the things that exist in the world of the book are things that could exist now, so it lacks the showstopping big ideas of previous books. Most of the interesting MMORPG concepts come in the first couple hundred pages. After that, Stephenson chooses to spend quite a bit of time geeking out over guns - the last third of the book reads like a spy thriller with lots of shooting and very little traditional sci-fi geekery. <!-- more --></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delusions-Gender-Society-Neurosexism-Difference/dp/0393340244/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346121789&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=delusions+of+gender">Delusions of Gender</a><br />
<strong>What is it:</strong> Cordelia Fine does an amazing job summarizing the current literature that shows differences (or lack there of) between genders. It’s meant for a lay audience, so even the portions that go in-depth on neuroscience concepts are approachable. In many ways, this was a book I’ve always wanted to have access to for those pesky fights about gender differences, so I’m glad I found it. The sections on stereotype threat should be required reading for everyone who works in STEM fields.</p>

<p><strong>Should you read it:</strong> Definitely. Highly recommended if you’re interested in how studies and science work, or interested in perceptions of gender. Still worth a read for everyone else too. I wish the author hadn’t fallen into the common female author trope of talking about her husband and her relationship, but the book is so excellent overall that I’m willing to forgive it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Other-Survival-Signals-Protect-Violence/dp/0440508835/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346121765&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+gift+of+fear">The Gift of Fear</a><br />
<strong>What is it:</strong> A pop psych book by Gavin de Becker, an expert on abuse and violent behavior. The basic premise is that we all have instincts that tell us when something is about to go wrong or when people’s behavior doesn’t track with our experiences, and learning to recognize those can protect you. I ended up reading this book because it’s often recommended in the femo-sphere, on blogs like <a href="http://captainawkward.com/">Captain Awkward</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Should you read it:</strong> Eh, probably not. It reads like de Becker is selling you a product, for example, his consulting firm, and thus sounds like Art Smith on Top Chef Masters (loaded with references to famous clients). de Becker’s thesis also leads to lots of victim-blaming, or stuff that sounds a lot like it. Since we all have instincts that allows us to protect ourselves, those who ended up abused or injured clearly weren’t listening to their instincts hard enough. It’s not particularly enjoyable or fun, although it goes pretty fast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Some-Remarks-Essays-Other-Writing/dp/0062024434/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346121815&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=some+remarks">Some Remarks</a><br />
<strong>What is it:</strong> More Neal Stephenson! Some Remarks is a collection of Neal Stephenson’s non-fiction pieces, mostly already published elsewhere. It includes an interview he did with <a href="http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor">Slashdot</a>, the Wired piece <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.12/ffglass_pr.html">Mother Earth Mother Board</a>, and some speeches.</p>

<p><strong>Should you read it:</strong> YES YES YES. Neal Stephenson freed from having to pretend he cares about character and plot structure = awesome. There’s a lot of powerful ideas and interesting structures and classifications. In particular, Mother Earth Mother Board is great.</p>

<p>Okay, so you don’t actually need to buy this book - a lot of the stuff in it is freely available online, as linked to above. However, if you like paper, or if you want to have everything collected for you, Some Remarks is kind of nice.</p>
