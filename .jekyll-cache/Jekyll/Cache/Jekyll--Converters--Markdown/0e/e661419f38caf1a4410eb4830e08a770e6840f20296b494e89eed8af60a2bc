<p>Hey there! I’m Kendra, a technology lawyer and a scholar of computing, gender, and society.</p>

<p>By day, I’m a clinical instructor at the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School, where I teach students to practice technology law. I am a radical generalist and will work on pretty much anything technology-related. Some recent (public) highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helping Fight for the Future, an digital rights advocacy organization, fight back against a <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-02-22-fight-for-the-future-statement-on-proctorios-attempt-to-silence-critics-through-legal-bullying">retalitatory and overbroad subpoena</a> from Proctorio, an e-proctoring company.</li>
  <li>Working with sex worker art collective Veil Machine to provide legal support for their art show <a href="https://veilmachine.com/E-Viction">E-Viction</a>, that protested digital gentrification.</li>
  <li>Representing Paul Kruczynski when he recieved a takedown letter from Instagram for his use of the Instagram trademark in the domain name “dontuseinstagram.com.”</li>
</ul>

<p>My scholarship, writing, and speaking focus on questions of digital technology and power, especially in relationship to gender and sexuality. Some representative examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My legal scholarship focuses on FOSTA/SESTA, a 2018 law that changed how liability worked for online platforms around sex trafficking and prostitution. With Elizabeth Brundige and Lorelei Lee, I published a descriptive article, <a href="https://hrlr.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/fosta-in-legal-context/">FOSTA in Legal Context</a>, which aimed to situate FOSTA in relationship to the Mann Act and the Travel Act. More recently, I have an article called Five Reflections from Four Years of FOSTA/SESTA, forthcoming in the Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal, which tries to summarize what working with sex workers on FOSTA has taught me.</li>
  <li>With Maggie Delano, I’ve written about how non-binary people are excluded from “smart scales” and what this means about inclusion in health technologies more generally, in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445898">“This Whole Thing Smacks of Gender”</a>.</li>
  <li>With Ram Shankar Siva Kumar and others, I’ve written and spoken about how to apply law to adversarial attacks on machine learning systems. Our Blackhat talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3_4ViYRi20">“Smashing the ML Stack for Fun and Lawsuits”</a> is a great summary, or you can check out the fuller range of papers on my <a href="https://Kserra.github.io/KendraCV.pdf">CV</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also hold an appointment as a lecturer on Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality at Harvard University, where I teach a class on transgender rights and the law. In 2019, I founded the <a href="https://www.ifrfa.org/">Initiative for a Representative First Amendment (IfRFA)</a>, which provides funding and support for law students from backgrounds tradtionally underrepresented in First Amendment law. I currently serve as IfRFA’s director, working alongside the incredible Jasjot Kaur.</p>

<p>When I’m not working or teaching or writing, I try to make the world suck less. I have a side business facilitating <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/allyskills.html">workshops on anti-oppressive practices</a>, and I reinvest money from that work into community mutual aid. Other than that, I spend my free time reading, playing video games, cooking, and finding new ways to organize my life.</p>

<p>I tweet at <a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra">@KendraSerra</a>. I occasionally blog about things I’ve been thinking about. Reach me by email at kendra dot serra at gmail dot com. My pronouns are <a href="./Gender.html">they/them/theirs</a>. For more info on my background and accomplishments, feel free to peruse my <a href="https://Kserra.github.io/KendraCV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
