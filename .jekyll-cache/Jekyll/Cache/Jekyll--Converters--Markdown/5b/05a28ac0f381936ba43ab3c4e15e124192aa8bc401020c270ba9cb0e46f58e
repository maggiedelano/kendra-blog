<p>Books: Toast, How to Fake A Moon Landing, Going Clear, The Poison Eaters, Ancient Ancient</p>

<p>So I own and love Plenty, which is Nigel Slaterâ€™s recipe book for vegetables, so Toast, which is his memoir about food, seemed like an obvious next step. I was pretty taken aback by the content - it reminded me pretty strongly of Boy, Roald Dahlâ€™s book about his fucked up childhood, more in the branding than anything else. At this point every memoir Iâ€™ve read about growing up as a young boy in Britain (and Iâ€™m at something like 4 now) has included some child abuse and lots of weird stuff that was not telegraphed by the book marketing. So yeah, Toast was fine - depressing as all get out, does not make you want to eat, etc, but fine. I guess, if you donâ€™t mind that the book include a trigger warned for child abuse.</p>

<p>How to Fake A Moon Landing is a series of comics packaged in book form handling topics commonly covered by scientific skepticism. Itâ€™s by Darryl Cunningham - who had a wonderful <a href="http://darryl-cunningham.blogspot.com/2010/06/homeopathy.html">strip on homeopathy</a> which made the Internet rounds a couple of years ago. Given that I was familiar with his work, I picked up the book expecting to enjoy it, and was shocked by how much I didnâ€™t. Thereâ€™s other better handling of the same material elsewhere, and Cunninghamâ€™s style comes off as boring and condescending. Itâ€™s also just a collection of his comic strips, with nothing in between and no cohesive themes or build up - which means that itâ€™s actually inferior to reading the same strips on the Internet, where you can at least read the comments. This was one of the bigger let downs of the books Iâ€™ve read recently.</p>

<p>Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief is by Lawrence Wright, and is a Hollywood and personality-centric look at the religion of Scientology. The book is great - interesting, well told, and clear, with footnotes that explain where the narrative was disputed by key players. (AKA - all of the upper level members of Scientology disputing any claims of abuse.) The only thing I didnâ€™t love about it was the focus on Hollywood actors. Tom Cruiseâ€™s role in Scientology is notable, but by far the least interesting part of a long and complicated story. Some of the details of his influence and interactions with the religion could have been eliminated, and the book would have been stronger for it.</p>

<p>The Poison Eaters - short story collection, all Holly Black, variety of settings and themes, mostly fantastical and horror. I think I have finally come to the conclusion that I should stop reading short story collections. I keep trying, and I always find that they have ups and downs - and it bothers me. Blackâ€™s work reminds me a bit of Paolo Bacigalupi - the settings are evocative, but often I would get turned off by the content and sometimes the plots were hard to follow.Â </p>

<p>Ancient Ancient - also a short story collection, also hit or miss, also dark. Some of the stories in this were really great, including one about a species that comes to Earth and seduces humans for nectar - others differed stylistically, and werenâ€™t to my tastes.Â </p>
