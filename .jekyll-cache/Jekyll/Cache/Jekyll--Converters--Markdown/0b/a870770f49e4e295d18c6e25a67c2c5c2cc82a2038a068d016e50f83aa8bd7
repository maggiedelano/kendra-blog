I"†<p>Last week, I organized a letter in support of Baby Blue, Carl Malamud and Chris Sprigmanâ€™s open citation manual. Over 165 students, faculty and staff signed on in less than a week. For posterity, the letter is available <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5027557/Baby%20Blue%20Support%20Letter%202-12.pdf">here</a>. I also wrote an op-ed which appeared in the <a href="http://hlrecord.org/2016/02/harvard-law-review-should-welcome-free-citation-manual-not-threaten-lawsuits/">Harvard Law Record</a>, and which Iâ€™m reproducing below, titled â€œHarvard Law Review Should Welcome Free Citation Manual, Not Threaten Lawsuits.â€</p>
