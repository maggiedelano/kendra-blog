I"•<p>Last August, Jon Hanson asked me, as an alum, to give a talk to a group of Harvard Law School 1Ls aboutÂ â€œlife in the law.â€ It was one of the hardest talks Iâ€™ve ever given, because itâ€™s some of the subject matter thatâ€™s still the rawest for me. Itâ€™s been sitting on my hard drive for a while, and although it fills me with anxiety, I figure itâ€™s long past time I share it publicly.Â </p>
