I"ü<p>I recently published <a href="https://blog.harvardlawreview.org/their-law/">an essay</a>Â responding to <em>They, Them, andÂ __Theirs</em>, an article on non-binary inclusion. (Yes, the title is a reference to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz9I0WJxF84">The Prodigy song</a>.)Â </p>

<p>Iâ€™ll quote the beginning here:Â </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œMany gender-neutral restrooms and locker rooms are behind locked doors. Â Not in the same sense that all bathroom doors are locked; rather, these spaces can be accessed only by either being lucky enough to slip in behind someone with authorization, or by pleading oneâ€™s case before some sort of decision makerâ€”a literal gatekeeper. Â In the most immediate sense, itâ€™s the gym manager (â€œCan I use the temporary gender neutral facility?â€), the information desk person (â€œCan you let me into the family restroom?â€), or the key card provisioner (â€œI need access to the other floor because thatâ€™s where the bathroom I can use is. Please.â€).</p>

  <p>Other aspects of gender-neutral life can require a different, but intimately related, set of recitations to a more metaphorical set of gatekeepers. Â Sometimes these pleas are heard by a therapist (â€œCan you give me a diagnosis so I can get this covered by my insurance?â€), a doctor (â€œPlease just let me have the anti-depressants so I donâ€™t become another suicide statistic.â€), or a judge (â€œYour honor, donâ€™t make me publish my old name and new name in the newspaper in order to effectuate my name change.â€). Â Other times they are addressed to an HR manager (â€œMy colleague called me by the wrong pronouns for the entire meeting and my boss didnâ€™t correct him.â€), a lawyer (â€œThe new shift manager kept snickering about my pronoun pin and marked me as late even when I wasnâ€™tâ€¦do you think I have a case?â€), or an athletics organizing body (â€œLook, I just want to lift weights, okay? I donâ€™t care which category Iâ€™m in.â€).</p>

  <p>It is the law that underlies these requests that Professor Jessica Clarke takes up in <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/2019/01/they-them-and-theirs/">They, Them, and Theirs</a>, her law review article on nonbinary people. Â Rather than focusing on the moral claim that nonbinary people should have their genders taken seriously, Clarke takes up the logistical arguments that critics have mounted against nonbinary gender claims. Â Most simply, she argues that including nonbinary people in existing social institutions would not require radical changes to the law.</p>

  <p>â€¦</p>

  <p>Clarkeâ€™s thesis is not wrong. Â She ably points out many ways in which nonbinary people can fit easily into existing systems and pushes back against common arguments, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/01/13/462906419/everyone-uses-singular-they-whether-they-realize-it-or-not">from the tyranny of grammar</a> to the <a href="http://time.com/4702962/gender-neutral-bathrooms/">imagined threat of sexual predators in restrooms</a>. Â There is certainly a strategic argument to support the integration of nonbinary people into existing systems of state-sponsored gender. Â But advocates for nonbinary people should not start with a goal of assimilation, even if that is where they end. Â </p>
